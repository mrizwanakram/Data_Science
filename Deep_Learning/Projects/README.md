# PaddleOCR Number Plate Detection

This repository contains code to perform number plate detection using the PaddleOCR library. The code processes images from a specified folder, detects number plates, and saves the result images with bounding boxes in an output folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PaddleOCR library
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Pillow

## Installation

```bash
pip install paddleocr opencv-python matplotlib Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paddleocr-numberplate.git
cd paddleocr-numberplate
```

2. Create input and output folders:

```bash
mkdir cctv_images
mkdir output_results
```

3. Place your input images (e.g., number plates) in the `cctv_images` folder.

4. Run the script:

```bash
python detect_numberplates.py
```

Detected images with bounding boxes will be saved in the `output_results` folder.

## Customization

- Modify `detect_numberplates.py` to change input/output folder paths or adjust parameters.
